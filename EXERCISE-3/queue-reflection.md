## Queue Reflection: Why FIFO Ensures Orderliness in Mass Events

The FIFO (First-In, First-Out) principle of queues ensures that people are served in the exact order they arrive. In mass events like concerts, this prevents confusion and disputes, as everyone knows their position and turn. It promotes fairness, reduces crowding at entry points, and helps organizers manage large groups efficiently. By maintaining a clear sequence, FIFO queues create a smooth, organized flow, ensuring safety and satisfaction for all attendees.
